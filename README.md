## Suggesting plugins
Feel free to suggest plugins in the issues. Only cosmetic plugins and **minor** gameplay changes will be accepted. We'll then vote, wait a bit and if enough people like the idea, it'll get added.

## Current changes
- randomTickSpeed is set to 5 (default 1)
- payerSleepPercentage is set to 1 (default 100)
- All kinds of potions are stackable up to 16 (default 1)
- view and simulation distance is set to 20 (default 10, I think)
- entity-tracking-range is set to 256 for players, 128 for the rest
